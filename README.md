# SummerResearch

This is the repository that holds all the code that I will write/use that
pertains to the analysis of BBH triggers and Omicron triggers for aLIGO during
the ER7 run.

Current scripts and their descriptions:
  1. plot_alltriggers: reads in BBH triggers in xml or npz format and generates
     plots of the SNR, chirp mass and other plots that I will think about.
